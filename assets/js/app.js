// Your JS can go here! Pull in or write whatever you want.
//
// For example, to add in Bootstrap 4 JS:
// jQuery is already being pulled in via the webpack.config.js file.

import 'bootstrap';

// It's recommended that you only pull in the Bootstrap modules you need.
// You can do this by pulling in the /js/dist/*.js files under bootstrap
// Example:
//
// import 'bootstrap/js/dist/alert.js';
